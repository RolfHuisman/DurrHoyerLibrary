An open source implementation of the quantum minimum searching algorithm and the quantum exponential searching algorithm. 

Currently functionality allows for finding a unique solution, paired with QMSA this is done in O(sqrt(N)) at a 50% success rate. 

Future functionality will allow for finding mulitple solutions with an alleviated O() leading to a better success rate.
